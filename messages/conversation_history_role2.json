However, I can guide you to calculate the stiffness matrix based on typical assumptions.\n\n### Analyzing Groove Orientation\nAssuming the groove primarily extends in the Y-direction (depth), the coordinate system for the groove would be:\n- X-axis: perpendicular to the groove\n- Y-axis: along the groove\n- Z-axis: vertical\n\n### Assigning Stiffness Along Each Axis\n- **High stiffness** along the Y-axis (e.g., 1000 N/m).\n- **Low stiffness** along the X and Z-axes (e.g., 100 N/m).\n\n### Construct \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\)\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n100 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1000 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 100\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSince the groove aligns with the Y-axis, no further rotation is necessary, and this matrix directly becomes the camera frame stiffness matrix.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1000, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"}]}]
