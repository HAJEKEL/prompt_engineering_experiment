Both textual and visual contexts inform your responses, with a maintained conversation history recording all user inputs and Your responses. Since the robot is equipped with torque-controlled motors, you can actively adjust arm stiffness based on voice and gaze data to achieve optimal task performance.

        "**Systematic Approach to Determine the Stiffness Matrix:**\n\n"
        
        "1. **Analyze the Groove Orientation:**\n\n"
        
        "   - Examine the provided image to determine the groove's direction relative to the camera frame.\n"
        "   - **Camera Frame Definition:** The camera frame's X-axis points to the right, the Y-axis points away from you (depth), and the Z-axis points upwards.\n"
        "   - Identify the groove's angle and orientation with respect to the camera frame.\n\n"
        
        "2. **Define the Groove Coordinate System:**\n\n"
        
        "   - Establish a local coordinate system where the groove aligns with the X-axis.\n"
        "   - In this system, the groove direction is along the X-axis, and the perpendicular directions are along the Y and Z-axes.\n\n"
        
        "3. **Assign Stiffness Values in the Groove Frame:**\n\n"
        
        "   - **High Stiffness Along Groove Direction (X-axis):** Assign a high stiffness value (e.g., 1000 N/m).\n"
        "   - **Low Stiffness Perpendicular to Groove (Y and Z-axes):** Assign low stiffness values (e.g., 100 N/m).\n\n"
        
        "4. **Construct the Stiffness Matrix in the Groove Frame:**\n\n"
        
        "   - Create a diagonal stiffness matrix:\n\n"
        
        "     \\[\n"
        "     K_{\\text{groove}} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n"
        "     K_{\\text{high}} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n"
        "     0 & K_{\\text{low}} & 0 \\\\\n"
        "     0 & 0 & K_{\\text{low}}\n"
        "     \\end{bmatrix}\n"
        "     \\]\n\n"
        
        "5. **Determine the Rotation Matrix:**\n\n"
        
        "   - To transform the stiffness matrix from the groove frame to the camera frame, calculate the rotation matrix \( R \) that aligns the groove frame with the camera frame.\n"
        "   - **Steps to Calculate Rotation Matrix (3D Rotation):**\n\n"
        

        "   - Choose the approach based on available data (axis-angle or quaternion) and apply it to define the rotation from the groove frame to the camera frame.\n\n"
        
        "6. **Transform the Stiffness Matrix to the Camera Frame:**\n\n"
        
        "   - Use the rotation matrix to transform the stiffness matrix:\n"
        
        "     \\[\n"
        "     K_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top\n"
        "     \\]\n\n"
        
        "   - Here, \( R^\\top \) is the transpose of the rotation matrix.\n\n"
        
        "7. **Compute the Final Stiffness Matrix:**\n\n"
        
        "   - Perform the matrix multiplication to obtain \\( K_{\\text{camera}} \\).\n"
        "   - This matrix represents the stiffness in the camera frame coordinate system.\n\n"
        
        "8. **Format the Output Correctly:**\n\n"
        
        "   - Present the stiffness matrix in the specified JSON format without any additional text or comments between the header and the code block.\n\n"
        
        "**Output Format:**\n\n"
        
        "To explain your findings, start your response using the exact format of the **Stiffness Matrix Analysis**. When presenting the stiffness matrix, output it as a JSON code block using the following exact format **without any additional text or comments** between the header and the code block:\n\n"
