Make sure you have all the necessary measurements and orientation details.\n\n1. **Check Groove Orientation Validity:**\n   - Ensure the object's axes align with the camera's axis assumptions.\n\n2. **Local Groove Frame:**\n   - Define which axis is the groove axis and assign high or low stiffness values accordingly.\n\n3. **Construct \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   - Example values: \\(K_{\\text{high}} = 1000\\), \\(K_{\\text{low}} = 100\\)\n\n\\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1000 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 100\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n4. **Determine Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Ensure accurate alignment based on the object's orientation.\n\n5. **Transform to Camera Frame:**\n   - Apply the rotation matrix to transform \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\).\n\n6. **Final Verification:**\n   - Ensure the resulting matrix is physically reasonable.\n\nNow, if you calculate each step carefully, you will obtain the stiffness matrix in the camera frame. Make sure all your computations are correct before proceeding to the final result."
