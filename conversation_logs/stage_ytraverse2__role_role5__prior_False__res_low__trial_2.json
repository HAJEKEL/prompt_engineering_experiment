The groove appears to be oriented in a way that suggests aligning with the camera's Y-axis (depth) and Z-axis (upward), while the X-axis runs perpendicular to the screen's plane.\n\nGiven this orientation, we can set up a stiffness matrix with higher stiffness along the groove direction (aligned with X-axis in the local groove frame) and lower stiffness perpendicular to it.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 250, 0],\n    [0, 0, 250]\n  ]\n}\n```"
