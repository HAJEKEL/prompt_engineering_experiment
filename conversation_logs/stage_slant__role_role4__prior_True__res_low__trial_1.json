The groove section highlighted by the red circle seems to be at an angle in the Y-Z plane.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix Calculation\n\n**Description:**\n- The slanted groove is approximately 45\u00b0 between the Y and Z axes.\n- Stiffness is expected to be split equally between Y and Z.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1. Split the stiffness equally in Y and Z.\n2. Use 176.78 N/m for both Y and Z axes based on \\(0.5\\sqrt{2} \\times 250\\).\n3. X remains at different stiffness, assuming 100 N/m.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 176.78, 0],\n    [0, 0, 176.78]\n  ]\n}\n```"
