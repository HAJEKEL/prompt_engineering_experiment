The image indicates the groove is aligned with the x-axis, hence the principal stiffness is also in the same direction.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. Stiffness is highest in x, equal to 250 N/m.\n2. Y and Z stiffness remain at 100 N/m.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
