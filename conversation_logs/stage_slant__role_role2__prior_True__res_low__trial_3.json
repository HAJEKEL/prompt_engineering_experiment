We calculate equal distribution of stiffness along Y and Z.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\nTo determine stiffness, use high stiffness of 250 N/m split equally between Y and Z:\n- Each axis: \\(0.5\\sqrt{2} \\times 250 \\approx 176.78 \\, \\text{N/m}\\).\n- X remains at 100 N/m.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 176.78, 0],\n    [0, 0, 176.78]\n  ]\n}\n```"
