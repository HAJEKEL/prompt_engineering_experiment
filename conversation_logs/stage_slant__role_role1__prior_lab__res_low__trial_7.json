Here, the groove advances along the y-axis and ascends in the z-direction following a positive slope. This structure requires similar stiffness along Y and Z to accommodate the incline, depicted by the off-diagonal elements in the stiffness matrix.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. The groove follows the equation z = y.\n2. The x-coordinate remains fixed at 100.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 175, 75],\n    [0, 75, 175]\n  ]\n}\n```"
