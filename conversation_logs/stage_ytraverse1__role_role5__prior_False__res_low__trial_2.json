The red circle indicates the user's gaze is focused on the left vertical section of the groove. \n\n### Steps to Compute the Stiffness Matrix:\n\n1. **Clarify Groove Direction in Camera Coordinates:**\n   - The U-shaped groove appears to be aligned with its base parallel to the bottom of the image. The sections extend vertically along the Y-axis in camera coordinates.\n  \n2. **Establish Local Groove Axes:**\n   - Align the base of the U-shape along the X-axis, treating the perpendicular directions (including depth through the groove) as Y and Z axes.\n   - The groove's primary direction is horizontal, indicating high stiffness should align here.\n\n3. **Compose \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   - Assign higher stiffness to the X-axis (250) since this follows the groove direction, and lower stiffness (100) for both Y and Z.\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 100\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Since the groove appears aligned primarily along one axis without significant angular rotation needed, the rotation matrix can be approximated as an identity matrix.\n\n5. **Apply Transformation:**\n   \\[\n     K_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top\n   \\]\n   When \\( R \\) is the identity matrix, \\( K_{\\text{camera}} \\) equals \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\).\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
