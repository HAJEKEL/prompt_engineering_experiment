        "text": "The image shows a complex groove pattern displayed on a screen, with a highlighted section indicated by a red circle. The groove appears to have several directional changes, resembling an extended 'L' shape.\n\nTo compute the stiffness matrix, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Clarify Groove Direction:**\n   - The groove initially runs vertically (upward) and then shifts horizontally to the left.\n\n2. **Establish Local Groove Axes:**\n   - Given the groove shape, let's assume the major axis of interest is along the initial vertical direction, which is aligned with the camera's Z-axis. Consequently, the X-axis is perpendicular in the horizontal plane, and the Y-axis will be in the depth direction.\n\n3. **Compose \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     100 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 250\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - No significant rotation needed as the main direction aligns with the camera Z-axis initially. Hence, \\( R \\) is essentially the identity matrix.\n\n5. **Apply Transformation:**\n   \\[\n     K_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top\n   \\]\n   This calculation keeps \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\) unchanged.\n\n6. **Finalize Matrix:**\n   - The stiffness matrix reflects a higher stiffness in the groove\u2019s vertical direction.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 250]\n  ]\n}\n```"
