The groove appears to have a generally straight orientation with one bend.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n\nTo compute the stiffness matrix based on the groove orientation:\n\n1. **Clarify Groove Direction**: Assume the main axis of the groove aligns with the camera's X-axis with a bend changing direction.\n2. **Local Groove Axes Orientation**: \n   - High stiffness along the X-axis of the groove.\n   - Lower stiffness in the perpendicular Y and Z directions.\n\n3. **Rotation Matrix**: Given the straight sections and a single bend, you might model rotations as needed.\n4. **Apply Transformation**: If there\u2019s a bend, estimate rotation matrix \\( R \\) based on the camera to groove alignment.\n\nGiven the assumed main direction and symmetry, starting with direct transformation could be:\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
