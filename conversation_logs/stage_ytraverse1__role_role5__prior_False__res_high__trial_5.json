The red circle indicates a section along the left side of the groove. \n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n\nBased on the orientation:\n\n1. **Groove Direction**: The groove appears to be oriented relative to the object in such a way that it curves in a U-shape and the focus is on the left straight section.\n2. **Establish Local Groove Axes**: Let's assume X is along the groove, with higher stiffness in this direction for stable movement. Lower stiffness in the Y and Z directions, which are perpendicular to the groove.\n\nGiven these assumptions, here's an example calculation:\n\n1. **Local Stiffness Matrix \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\)**:\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 100\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rotation Matrix \\( R \\)**:\n   - Assume \\( R \\) is the identity matrix for simplicity in this example.\n   - \\( R = I \\) (No rotation needed if the assumption is aligned)\n\n3. **Transform to Camera Coordinates \\( K_{\\text{camera}} \\)**:\n   - \\( K_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top \\)\n   - Resulting in \\( K_{\\text{camera}} = K_{\\text{groove}} \\)\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
