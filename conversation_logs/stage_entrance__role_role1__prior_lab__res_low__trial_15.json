The design ensures that to move in or out of this groove without damaging it, stiffness is highest in the Z direction, aligned with vertical movements, while maintaining lower stiffness in the X and Y directions.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. The primary force direction is X and Y, assuming a vertical motion approach, needing higher Z-direction stiffness.\n2. Hence, maximum stiffness is in the Z axis.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
