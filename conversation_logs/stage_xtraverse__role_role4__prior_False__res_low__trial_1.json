Ensure the groove orientation is correct with the expected angle ranges.\n\n2. **Local Groove Frame:**\n   - Define the X-axis along the groove length. Assign the Y and Z axes as perpendicular to this axis.\n\n3. **Construct \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   - Assign values for high and low stiffness along the axes. The matrix will look like:\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     K_{\\text{high}} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & K_{\\text{low}} & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & K_{\\text{low}}\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Apply any necessary rotations to align the groove frame to the camera frame. Use axis-angle or quaternion methods.\n\n5. **Transform to Camera Frame:**\n   \\[\n     K_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Verification:**\n   - Ensure the matrix is positive definite and the values are physically plausible.\n\n7. **Output the Stiffness Matrix:**\n   - Format it in JSON as shown below.\n\nFill in the specific stiffness values based on your application context for high and low stiffness axes."
