Here\u2019s a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Check Groove Orientation Validity:**\n   - Verify that the camera's coordinate system is defined, with X-axis to the right, Y-axis forward, and Z-axis upward.\n\n2. **Local Groove Frame:**\n   - Determine the groove's primary axis for high stiffness (X-axis).\n   - Identify the remaining two axes (Y and Z) for lower stiffness.\n\n3. **Construct \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   K_{\\text{high}} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & K_{\\text{low}} & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & K_{\\text{low}}\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n   - Typical values might be \\( K_{\\text{high}} = 1000 \\) N/mm and \\( K_{\\text{low}} = 100 \\) N/mm, but verify based on your specific setup.\n\n4. **Determine Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Use the known groove orientation to construct this matrix, considering potential noise.\n\n5. **Transform to Camera Frame:**\n   \\[\n   K_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Verification:**\n   - Ensure the resulting matrix is positive definite and the values are plausible.\n\nPlease ensure groove orientation and stiffness values fit your specific setup. Without specific groove position data, numerical computation from a general setup cannot be completed. Adjust values based on the real setup and measurements."
