The gaze point, indicated by the red circle, suggests interest in the angled part transitioning between the two segments.\n\n2. **Set Up Groove Coordinate System:**\n   - Assume the local x-axis runs along the visible groove on the right.\n   - The y-axis is perpendicular to the groove surface.\n   - The z-axis is vertical and perpendicular to both.\n\n3. **Assign Stiffness:**\n   - High stiffness (250 N/m) along the groove direction (local x-axis).\n   - Lower stiffness (100 N/m) in the perpendicular axes (local y and z).\n\n4. **Construct \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 100\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Assume the piece is aligned with the camera frame such that rotation is unnecessary.\n\n6. **Transform to Camera Frame:**\n   - Since \\( R \\) is the identity matrix, \\( K_{\\text{camera}} = K_{\\text{groove}} \\).\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
