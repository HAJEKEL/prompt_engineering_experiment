The red circle highlights a section of the groove at an angle, suggesting a transition or curved path in the structure.\n\n**Stiffness Matrix Calculation:**\nFor an angled segment, assume the force is shared equally between two axes (Y and Z).\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1. Stiffness needs to balance between Y and Z.\n2. Each axis receives ~176.78 N/m.\n3. X retains 100 N/m.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 176.78, 0],\n    [0, 0, 176.78]\n  ]\n}\n```"
