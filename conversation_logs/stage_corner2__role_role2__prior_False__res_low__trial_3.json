Let's determine the stiffness matrix based on these observations.\n\n### Groove Analysis\n1. **Groove Orientation**: \n   - From the image, we observe a two-part groove forming a corner.\n   - Assume the first segment (vertical part of the \"L\") runs along the Y-axis (depth), and the second (horizontal part of the \"L\") runs along the X-axis (right).\n\n2. **Coordinate System Setup**:\n   - Local x-axis is along the first groove segment (Y-direction).\n   - Local y-axis runs along the second segment (X-direction).\n   - Local z-axis is perpendicular to the plane of the groove.\n\n3. **Assign Stiffness Values**:\n   - High stiffness along each groove direction (250 N/m), lower stiffness off-axis (100 N/m).\n\n### Stiffness Matrix Calculation\n\n1. **Local Groove Stiffness Matrix \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 250 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 100\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rotation Matrix \\( R \\)**:\n   - Assumption: Camera frame aligns with local frame without additional rotation for simplification.\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n   1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 1\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Transform to Camera Frame**:\n   \\[\n   K_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top\n   \\]\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 250, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
