This suggests a certain alignment within a coordinate frame.\n\n### Local Groove Axes:\n1. Assume the groove direction aligns with the X-axis of the local groove coordinate.\n2. The Y and Z axes will remain perpendicular to the X-axis.\n\n### Compose \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):\nThe typical stiffness matrix aligned with the groove's local axes can be represented as:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 100\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):\nTo transform this into the camera's coordinate system, derive the rotation matrix \\( R \\) that represents the groove's orientation relative to the camera's axes. Given the diagonal groove orientation, assume a simplified rotation.\n\n### Transformation:\nThe stiffness matrix in the camera frame \\( K_{\\text{camera}} \\) is obtained through:\n\\[\nK_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top\n\\]\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [200, 50, 50],\n    [50, 150, 50],\n    [50, 50, 150]\n  ]\n}\n``` \n\nThese values represent an approximate transformation, accounting for the groove alignment as visually interpreted. Adjustments can be made based on precise measurements or additional data."
