This segment likely experiences directional changes, so a uniform stiffness is advisable to manage the transition smoothly.\n\n**Stiffness Matrix Calculation:**\n\nSince this is a corner, we'll apply equal compliance in all axes to allow flexibility during directional changes.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- Stiffness is 100 N/m in x, y, and z.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
