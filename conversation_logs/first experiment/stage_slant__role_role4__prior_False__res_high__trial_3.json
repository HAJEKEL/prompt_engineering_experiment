Here's how you can proceed with it:\n\n1. **Check Groove Orientation Validity:**\n   - Ensure the groove's orientation is correct within your setup's coordinate system.\n\n2. **Local Groove Frame Setup:**\n   - Assume groove high stiffness along its axis, low stiffness in perpendicular directions.\n\n3. **Construct \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   K_{\\text{high}} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & K_{\\text{low}} & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & K_{\\text{low}}\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Apply any needed calibrations. Use appropriate methods to define this matrix.\n\n5. **Transform to Camera Frame:**\n   \\[\n   K_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Verification:**\n   - Ensure the matrix is positive definite and the values are plausible.\n\nConstruct your matrix based on these steps. If specific numerical values are known (e.g., \\( K_{\\text{high}}, K_{\\text{low}} \\), and \\( R \\)), you can substitute them in to get the stiffness matrix."
