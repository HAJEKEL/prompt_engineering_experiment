However, I can guide you through the steps to compute the stiffness matrix based on the groove details.\n\n### Steps to Compute the Stiffness Matrix:\n\n1. **Check Groove Orientation Validity:** Verify that the camera's axes are aligned: X-axis is to the right, Y-axis forward, Z-axis up.\n\n2. **Local Groove Frame:**\n   - Determine the groove's principal axis as the X-axis.\n   - Y and Z should be perpendicular.\n\n3. **Construct \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   - High stiffness along the X-axis, low stiffness along Y and Z.\n\n4. **Determine Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Consider any necessary transformation from the groove frame to the camera frame.\n\n5. **Transform to Camera Frame:**\n   \\[\n   K_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Verification:**\n   - Ensure the matrix is positive definite and plausible.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [1000, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAdjust the values as needed based on detailed measurements or specific experimental conditions."
