The groove appears to be aligned primarily along the horizontal axis of the image, suggesting it runs from left to right.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix Computation\n\n1. **Analyze Groove Orientation:**\n   - Assume the groove is aligned along the X-axis since it runs horizontally across the image.\n\n2. **Set Up Groove Coordinate System:**\n   - Local x-axis along the groove (horizontal in image).\n   - Local y-axis and z-axis are perpendicular, with the y-axis in the plane of the image and the z-axis perpendicular to it.\n\n3. **Assign Stiffness Along Each Axis:**\n   - High stiffness (250 N/m) along the x-axis.\n   - Lower stiffness (100 N/m) for y and z axes.\n\n4. **Construct \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n\n\\[\nK_{\\text{groove}} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 100\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n5. **Compute Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Since the groove aligns with the X-axis of the image, no significant rotation is needed. Therefore, \\( R \\) is the identity matrix.\n\n6. **Transform to Camera Frame:**\n   - \\( K_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top = K_{\\text{groove}} \\)\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
