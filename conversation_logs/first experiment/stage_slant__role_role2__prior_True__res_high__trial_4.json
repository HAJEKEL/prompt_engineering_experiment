This section seems to follow an angled direction in the Y\u2013Z plane.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. The segment forms roughly a 45\u00b0 angle in the Y\u2013Z plane.\n2. Stiffness is divided equally between Y and Z.\n\n**Calculation**\n- High stiffness of 250 N/m is divided equally between Y and Z, resulting in approximately 176.78 N/m each, due to the angle.\n- X stiffness remains at 100 N/m.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 176.78, 0],\n    [0, 0, 176.78]\n  ]\n}\n```"
