The groove appears to be oriented primarily along two directions: horizontally to the left (X-axis) and then vertically downward (Y-axis).\n\n### Steps to Compute the Stiffness Matrix:\n\n1. **Clarify Groove Direction in Camera Coordinates:**\n   - The X-direction is horizontal to the left in the image.\n   - The Y-direction is vertically downward.\n   - The Z-direction is perpendicular to the plane, upward.\n\n2. **Establish Local Groove Axes:**\n   - Align the internal groove direction with the X-axis.\n   \n3. **Compose \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   - Use higher stiffness along the X-axis for precision and lower stiffness on Y and Z for compliance.\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 100\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - No rotation is needed since the groove is aligned with the camera frame.\n\n5. **Apply Transformation:**\n   - In this case, no transformation is needed as the local axes align with the camera coordinates.\n\n6. **Finalize Matrix:**\n   - This is your stiffness matrix ready for implementation.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
