However, I can guide you through computing the stiffness matrix based on typical procedures related to groove structures as described earlier.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix Calculation Steps\n\n1. **Check Groove Orientation Validity:**\n   - Ensure that the reference frame (camera's X, Y, Z axes) is properly defined.\n\n2. **Local Groove Frame:**\n   - Define the high vs. low stiffness based on materials and geometry.\n\n3. **Construct \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   K_{\\text{high}} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & K_{\\text{low}} & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & K_{\\text{low}}\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Compute based on the necessary rotation to align the groove with the camera frame.\n\n5. **Transform to Camera Frame:**\n   \\[\n   K_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Verification:**\n   - Verify the positive definity and plausibility of the matrix.\n\nOnce these are determined numerically or theoretically based on your specific case, you can format the stiffness matrix in the JSON format as follows:\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [X-X Value, Y-X Value, Z-X Value],\n    [X-Y Value, Y-Y Value, Z-Y Value],\n    [X-Z Value, Y-Z Value, Z-Z Value]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nMake sure that each step aligns with your experimental setup or theoretical conditions."
