X and Z would be perpendicular.\n\n3. **Compose \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   - Set a higher stiffness along the groove (X-axis of the groove) and lower stiffness perpendicular to it:\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     100 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 250 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 100\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Assume the groove's orientation aligns as described.\n\n5. **Apply Transformation:**\n   - If additional information on the rotation is available, adjust accordingly. For now, assume no rotation is needed.\n\n6. **Finalize Matrix:**\n   - Resulting stiffness matrix in camera coordinates is essentially the default groove setting due to no rotation.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 250, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
