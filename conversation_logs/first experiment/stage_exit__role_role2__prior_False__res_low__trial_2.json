The direction appears to follow a horizontal line from left to right, relative to the image's perspective.\n\n2. **Set Up Groove Coordinate System:**\n    - Local x-axis: Align with the groove's main direction (horizontal in the image).\n    - Local y-axis: Perpendicular to the x-axis, into the image.\n    - Local z-axis: Perpendicular to the plane formed by x and y (upwards from the image).\n\n3. **Assign Stiffness Along Each Axis:**\n    - High stiffness along the groove axis (x-axis): 250 N/m.\n    - Lower stiffness off-axis (y and z-axes): 100 N/m.\n\n4. **Construct \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 100\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n    - Assume no rotation needed as the x-axis aligns with the camera's horizontal axis.\n\n6. **Transform to Camera Frame:**\n    - Since no rotation is assumed, \\( K_{\\text{camera}} \\) is the same as \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\).\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
