This suggests a point along the groove's path.\n\n### Groove Orientation\n1. **Groove Direction:** The groove runs diagonally from top left to bottom right.\n2. **Assumption:** Assume the upper left direction as the X-axis (right), down along the groove as the Y-axis (depth), and vertical as the Z-axis (up).\n\n### Coordinate System\n- Define the groove's coordinate system:\n  - **x-axis:** Along the groove\n  - **y-axis:** Perpendicular to the groove horizontally\n  - **z-axis:** Perpendicular to the groove vertically\n\n### Stiffness Assignment\n- **High stiffness** along the groove (x-axis): 250 N/m\n- **Lower stiffness** perpendicular to the groove (y and z-axes): 100 N/m\n\n### Groove Stiffness Matrix \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\)\n\\[\nK_{\\text{groove}} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 100\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Rotation Matrix \\( R \\)\n- Since the groove is oriented diagonally, a rotation matrix \\( R \\) is needed to align the groove's local frame with the camera frame. This can typically be found using axis-angle or similar transformations, though detailed calculation may require specific angles.\n\n### Transform to Camera Frame\nThe transformed matrix \\( K_{\\text{camera}} \\) is obtained by:\n\\[\nK_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top\n\\]\n\nFor simplicity and due to the lack of exact numerical orientation details, let's assume no rotation is needed here, considering only superficial alignment for the task's context.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
