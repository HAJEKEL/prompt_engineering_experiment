This section appears to be another corner or transition point in the groove.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\nFor a corner section, it's typically beneficial to have uniform stiffness to handle directional changes smoothly.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. Equal stiffness in x, y, z.\n2. Compliance ensures smooth directional transition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
