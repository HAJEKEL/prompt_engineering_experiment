The groove appears to have a horizontal orientation relative to the tabletop surface, which would correspond to the x-axis in our system.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix Calculation\n\n1. **Groove Orientation:**\n   - The groove is approximately aligned with the horizontal axis (x-axis).\n\n2. **Groove Coordinate System:**\n   - Local axes: \n     - x-axis along groove (horizontal)\n     - y and z axes perpendicular\n\n3. **Stiffness Assignments:**\n   - High stiffness along groove (x-axis): \\(K_{\\text{high}} = 250 \\, \\text{N/m}\\)\n   - Lower stiffness off-axis (y, z): \\(K_{\\text{low}} = 100 \\, \\text{N/m}\\)\n\n4. **Groove Stiffness Matrix \\(K_{\\text{groove}}\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 100\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Rotation Matrix \\(R\\):**\n   - Assuming identity for simplification here as the groove seems straightforwardly aligned with the camera x-axis.\n\n6. **Transformation to Camera Frame:**\n   - Since \\(R\\) is identity {\\(I\\)}, \\(K_{\\text{camera}} = K_{\\text{groove}}\\).\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
