The red circle indicates the user's gaze focused on this corner, suggesting interest in its specific orientation and potential entry point for a task.\n\nTo compute the stiffness matrix for the groove, we will assume the following:\n\n1. **Local Groove Axes Alignment:**\n   - Assume the groove along the X-axis with the corner positioning.\n\n2. **Base Stiffness Matrix in the Groove Frame:**\n   \\[\n   K_{\\text{groove}} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n   250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 100\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rotation to Camera Frame:**\n   - Without specific angles, assume no rotation for simplicity in this example.\n\n4. **Final Stiffness Matrix:**\n   - Since no rotation is applied, the stiffness matrix in the camera frame remains the same.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
