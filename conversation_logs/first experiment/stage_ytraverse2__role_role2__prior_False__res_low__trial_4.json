        "text": "To compute the stiffness matrix, let's start by analyzing the image:\n\n1. **Analyze Groove Orientation:**\n   - The groove seems to have a linear path with an angled bend. The gaze point (red circle) suggests attention to the ending segment perpendicular to the prior groove. \n\n2. **Set Up Groove Coordinate System:**\n   - Assuming the groove extends initially horizontally (X-axis) then bends vertically (Y-axis). The Z-axis will remain perpendicular to the display.\n\n3. **Assign Stiffness Along Each Axis:**\n   - Higher stiffness should be aligned with the main straight segment, and since the groove appears to have a bend, we should consider these two sections.\n   - For simplicity, let's assign high stiffness along the initial groove direction and lower stiffness along other axes.\n\n   We'll use: \n   \\[\n   K_{\\text{groove}} = \n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 100\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - The rotation matrix will align the local groove frame to the camera frame, which should be straightforward as the groove seems primarily aligned to the camera's horizontal view.\n\n5. **Transform to Camera Frame:**\n   - With the given orientation, assume the principal alignment fits the initial matrix without additional rotations.\n  \n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
