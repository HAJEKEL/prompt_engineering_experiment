The red circle around the top-left corner likely indicates the user's focus area, suggesting attention to the corner's orientation or a feature within that part.\n\nTo compute the stiffness matrix, let's identify the groove orientation:\n\n1. **Clarify Groove Direction:**\n   - The U-shaped groove suggests primary motion should align with the groove's path. For simplicity, let's assume the straight sections align with the X-axis of the local groove frame, while Y and Z remain perpendicular.\n\n2. **Establish Local Groove Axes:**\n   - Align the straight sections of the groove with X and adjust stiffness accordingly, maintaining flexibility in Y and Z directions to accommodate any necessary adjustments or clearances.\n\n3. **Compose \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 100\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Assume no rotation for the generalized model or adjust if specific corner orientation data is available later.\n\n5. **Apply Transformation:**\n   - If no rotation, the matrix remains unchanged. Otherwise, compute the final stiffness matrix in the camera frame.\n\nThe assumption here is no specific rotation from the groove's local orientation. If rotation is needed, details or data inputs should be provided to compute \\( R \\).\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
