This segment seems to align with the Y-axis of the structure.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix Computation\nGiven the primary alignment along the Y-axis, we'll prioritize stiffness in that direction.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. High stiffness along Y.\n2. Lower stiffness along X and Z.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 250, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
