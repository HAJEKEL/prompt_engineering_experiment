The groove advances along the x-axis, facilitating gradual insertion beyond the table plane, albeit with a limited negative slope. This phenomenon amplifies the required stiffness in the z and y directions, reflecting interrelated effects through off-diagonal elements in the stiffness matrix.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. The primary direction is along z.\n2. Equal stiffness is needed for x and y.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 250]\n  ]\n}\n```"
