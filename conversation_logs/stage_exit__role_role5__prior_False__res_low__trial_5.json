The red circle indicates the user's gaze at the bottom right segment of the groove.\n\n### Steps to Compute the Stiffness Matrix\n1. **Clarify Groove Direction in Camera Coordinates:**\n   - The groove appears to be oriented with the open end upwards towards the Z direction.\n\n2. **Establish Local Groove Axes:**\n   - Assume the groove runs along the X-axis, with Y and Z axes perpendicular.\n\n3. **Compose \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   - Based on typical higher stiffness along the groove:\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 100\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - No additional rotation seems necessary for this U-shaped groove as described.\n\n5. **Transformation:**\n   - Directly use \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\) since the assumed axis orientation aligns without need for adjustment.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
