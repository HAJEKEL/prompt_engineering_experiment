The groove appears to be oriented primarily along the horizontal axis of the image.\n\nTo compute the stiffness matrix, we will assume the following based on the groove's appearance:\n\n1. **Analyze Groove Orientation:**\n   - The groove is primarily horizontal in the image (left to right).\n\n2. **Set Up Groove Coordinate System:**\n   - Local x-axis is along the groove (horizontal).\n   - Local y-axis and z-axis are perpendicular.\n\n3. **Assign Stiffness Along Each Axis:**\n   - High stiffness along the groove (x-axis): 250 N/m.\n   - Lower stiffness perpendicular to the groove (y and z-axis): 100 N/m.\n\n4. **Construct \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 100\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Assume Simple Alignment (No Rotation Matrix Needed):**\n   - As the groove appears horizontal with no visible tilt, we apply stiffness directly.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
