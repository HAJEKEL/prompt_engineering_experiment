The red circle seems to highlight a segment of the groove, which runs from left to right in the image.\n\n### Process to Determine the Stiffness Matrix:\n\n1. **Clarify Groove Direction:**\n   - In the camera coordinates: the groove is aligned along the X-axis (horizontal direction).\n   \n2. **Establish Local Groove Axes:**\n   - X is along the groove (horizontal).\n   - Y and Z are perpendicular to the groove.\n\n3. **Compose \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 100\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Since the groove is aligned with the X-axis, \\( R \\) is the identity matrix.\n\n5. **Apply Transformation:**\n   - The stiffness matrix in camera coordinates remains the same due to alignment.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
