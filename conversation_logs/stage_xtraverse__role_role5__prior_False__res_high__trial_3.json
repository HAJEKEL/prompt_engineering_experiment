The red circle highlights the top section of the groove.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix Calculation:\n\n1. **Clarify Groove Direction:**\n   - The groove primarily runs horizontally. This can be approximated along the X-axis in the camera coordinate system.\n\n2. **Establish Local Groove Axes:**\n   - X-axis: Along the length of the groove.\n   - Y and Z-axes are perpendicular to the groove direction.\n\n3. **Compose \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**\n   - High stiffness along the groove axis (X-axis) and lower stiffness in the perpendicular directions.\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 100\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**\n   - Assuming no rotation needed as alignment seems to match camera orientation.\n\n5. **Transform to Camera Coordinates:**\n   - Since no rotation is needed, \\( K_{\\text{camera}} = K_{\\text{groove}} \\).\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
