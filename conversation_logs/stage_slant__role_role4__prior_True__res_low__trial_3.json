This portion transitions from a vertical to a more horizontal orientation.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix Calculation\nThe groove is slanted, implying stiffness primarily shared between the Y and Z axes.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. Stiffness is divided between Y and Z (approximately equal contribution due to the slant).\n2. Each approximately \\( \\frac{250}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 176.78 \\) N/m.\n3. X remains less stiff at 100 N/m.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 176.78, 0],\n    [0, 0, 176.78]\n  ]\n}\n```"
