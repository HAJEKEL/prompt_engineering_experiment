The red circle indicates the gaze focus on a specific section of the groove, highlighting its sharp corner.\n\n### Groove Orientation Analysis\n1. **Clarify Groove Direction:**  \n   - The groove seems to open towards the top of the image, suggesting its local X-axis is oriented horizontally in the camera's view, from left to right.\n\n2. **Establish Local Groove Axes:**  \n   - Local X-axis is along the groove's length.\n   - Y and Z axes are perpendicular to the X-axis.\n\n3. **Initial Stiffness Matrix \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):**  \n   Given the groove's primary directionality:\n   \\[\n   K_{\\text{groove}} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n   250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 100\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):**  \n   Assuming no rotation needed since the X-axis is horizontal and aligns with the camera\u2019s frame.\n\n5. **Transformation:**  \n   Since there is no rotation, the stiffness matrix in camera coordinates remains the same as \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\).\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
