To move in or out of that we want to move in a direction normal to the table, so we want high stiffness in z direction and low in others to avoid damaging the groove.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. The movement is in the z direction.\n2. Stiffness is high in z direction and low x and y directions.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
