        "text": "The image shows an object with a groove that appears to change direction, forming a sort of \"U\" or \"N\" shape. Your gaze is directed towards the left side of the groove, suggesting that this is of particular interest for the task.\n\n### Clarifying Groove Direction\n- **Camera Coordinates:** X is to the right, Y is forward, and Z is upward.\n- **Groove Orientation:** The groove runs vertically along Y and curves. For simplification, assume the initial direction is along the Y-axis.\n\n### Local Groove Axes\n- **Define Axes:** Align the primary groove direction initially with the Y-axis.\n- **Stiffness Allocation:** High stiffness along the X-coordinate (perpendicular to groove entry), lower along Y and Z.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix in Local Groove Coordinates\n\\[\nK_{\\text{groove}} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n250 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 100\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Rotation to Camera Frame\nAssuming a simple initial alignment where local coordinates align with the global ones, \\( R \\) is an identity matrix, simplifying the transformation. Thus, the stiffness matrix remains unchanged.\n\n### Final Stiffness Matrix in Camera Coordinates\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [250, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
