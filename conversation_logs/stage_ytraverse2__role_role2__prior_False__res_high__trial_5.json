Let's compute the stiffness matrix:\n\n1. **Analyze Groove Orientation:**\n   - The groove appears to be oriented vertically in the image (along the Y-axis if the vertical direction is assumed as depth), relative to the camera frame.\n\n2. **Set Up Groove Coordinate System:**\n   - Assume the local x-axis is along the groove (depth), y-axis is horizontal, and z-axis is vertical (upward).\n\n3. **Assign Stiffness Along Each Axis:**\n   - High stiffness along the groove axis: 250 N/m in the Y direction.\n   - Lower stiffness off-axis: 100 N/m in the X and Z directions.\n\n4. **Construct \\( K_{\\text{groove}} \\):** \n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     100 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 250 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 100\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute Rotation Matrix \\( R \\):** \n   - Assuming alignment with camera, use the identity matrix for simplicity here.\n\n6. **Transform to Camera Frame:**\n   - Since we assume the groove is aligned with camera axes, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 250, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
