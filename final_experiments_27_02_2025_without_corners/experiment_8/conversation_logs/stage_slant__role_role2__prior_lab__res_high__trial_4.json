        "text": "The red circle in the image indicates a groove sloping downward at an angle of approximately 45\u00b0 within the X\u2013Z plane. In this particular orientation, the groove extends along the x-axis as it descends downward in the z-direction, thus having a negative slope. Due to the 45\u00b0 downward slope in the plane, this configuration introduces coupled stiffness effects in X and Z, represented by the off-diagonal terms in the stiffness matrix.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. The groove follows the equation \\( z = -x \\).\n2. The y-coordinate remains fixed at 100.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [175, 0, -75],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [-75, 0, 175]\n  ]\n}\n```"
