Specifically, the groove extends along the positive x-axis while descending in the y-direction, following a negative slope. The groove's 45\u00b0 downward slope introduces coupled stiffness effects in X and Y, represented by the off-diagonal terms in the stiffness matrix.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. The groove follows the equation y = -x.\n2. The z-coordinate remains fixed at 100.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [175, -75, 0],\n    [-75, 175, 0],\n    [0, 0, 100]\n  ]\n}\n```"
