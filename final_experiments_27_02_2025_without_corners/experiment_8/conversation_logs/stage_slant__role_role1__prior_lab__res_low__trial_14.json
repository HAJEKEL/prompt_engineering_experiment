Specifically, the groove extends along the y-axis while ascending in the z-direction, following a positive slope. The groove's 45\u00b0 upward slope introduces coupled stiffness effects in Y and Z, represented by the off-diagonal terms in the stiffness matrix.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. The groove follows the equation z = y.\n2. The x-coordinate remains fixed at 100.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 175, 75],\n    [0, 75, 175]\n  ]\n}\n```"
