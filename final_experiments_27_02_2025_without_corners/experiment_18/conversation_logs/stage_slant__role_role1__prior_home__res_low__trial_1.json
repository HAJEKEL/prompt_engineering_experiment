Anticipating that the groove enhances z-axis movements upon entry, it extends as described earlier. High stiffness is essential along the z-axis, minimizing reactions to x and y displacements.\n\n**Assumptions**\n- Aligned with high stiffness along the z-direction.\n- Low x and y values protect the groove structure.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [100, 0, 0],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [0, 0, 250]\n  ]\n}\n```"
