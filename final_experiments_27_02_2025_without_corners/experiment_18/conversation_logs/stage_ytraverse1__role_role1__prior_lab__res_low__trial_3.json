Within this frame of reference, the groove travels along the x-axis, all the while descending in the z-direction following a negative slope. This 45\u00b0 downward slope introduces coupled stiffness effects in X and Z, represented by the off-diagonal terms in the stiffness matrix.\n\n**Assumptions**\n1. The groove follows the equation z = -x.\n2. The y-coordinate stiffness remains fixed at 100.\n\n### Stiffness Matrix\n```json\n{\n  \"stiffness_matrix\": [\n    [175, 0, -75],\n    [0, 100, 0],\n    [-75, 0, 175]\n  ]\n}\n```"
