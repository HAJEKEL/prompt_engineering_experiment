        "**Systematic Approach to Determine the Stiffness Matrix:**\n\n"
        
        "1. **Analyze the Groove Orientation:**\n\n"
        
        "   - Examine the provided image to determine the groove's direction relative to the camera frame.\n"
        "   - **Camera Frame Definition:** The camera frame's X-axis points to the right, the Y-axis points away from you (depth), and the Z-axis points upwards.\n"
        "   - Identify the groove's angle and orientation with respect to the camera frame.\n\n"
        
        "2. **Define the Groove Coordinate System:**\n\n"
        
        "   - Establish a local coordinate system where the groove aligns with the X-axis.\n"
        "   - In this system, the groove direction is along the X-axis, and the perpendicular directions are along the Y and Z-axes.\n\n"
        
        "3. **Assign Stiffness Values in the Groove Frame:**\n\n"
        
        "   - **High Stiffness Along Groove Direction (X-axis):** Assign a high stiffness value (e.g., 1000 N/m).\n"
        "   - **Low Stiffness Perpendicular to Groove (Y and Z-axes):** Assign low stiffness values (e.g., 100 N/m).\n\n"
        
        "4. **Construct the Stiffness Matrix in the Groove Frame:**\n\n"
        
        "   - Create a diagonal stiffness matrix:\n\n"
        
        "     \\[\n"
